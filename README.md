# deep_learning_for_structured_data
revised repo for Manning book **Deep Learning with Structured Data** https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-structured-data

##Note:
This repo is a rework of the original repo for the book at https://github.com/ryanmark1867/manning (which is being kept in place for the convenience of MEAP users who have already started to use it. Improvements in this new repo include:
- rationalized file names
- simplified directory structure
- notebooks tested on Python 3.6 and Python 3.7 in free and for-fee environments
- config files used to remove hard-coded parameters
- code largely refactored to make it easier to follow and simpler to run

## Directory structure
- **data** - processed datasets and pickle files for intermediate datasets
- **deploy** - code for deploying the trained model using Rasa and Facebook Messenger, as described in chapter 8 of the book
- **models** - saved trained models
- **notebooks** - Jupyter notebooks **streetcar_data_preparation.ipynb** (data preparation) and **streetcar_model_training.ipynb** (model training) along with associated class and config files
- **pipelines** - pickled pipeline files generated by **streetcar_model_training.ipynb**. Together with the trained models these pipeline files are used in the deployment.
- **sql** - SQL used to generate a table that can be used for the simple SQL examples in chapter 5

## Background

- **https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-streetcar-delay-data/** original dataset
- **https://www.kaggle.com/knowledgegrappler/a-simple-nn-solution-with-keras-0-48611-pl** Kaggle submission that was used as input to creation of the Keras model used in this example
